# 42-Atlantis-Chatterbot-Auditing
Chatterbot project for the Atlantis curriculum at 42, auditing the project and providing feedback to improve the quality of the overall project. 


Project required used of rubocop in order to help maintain a stylized ruby structure that is considered standard when developing in ruby.

Project required integration with slackbot in order to test and interact with the bot.

Project required the ability to use the API to grab information and export it in some sort of file. Choice of file is excel due to how the information is stored, and it also returns said information back to user.


Project was completed on a dummy workspace so the token is not important. However if in a real bot service the token would be hidden and not pushed, and the information would be pulled differently for security purposes. However since this was auditing the project itself the workplace along with the token will not exist once the auditing has been completed.
